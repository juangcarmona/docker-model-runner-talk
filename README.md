# docker-model-runner-talk
A hands-on exploration of Docker Model Runner for running language models locally with Docker. Terminal-first: setup, CLI, containers, models, endpoints. Just models, containers, and a shell. We’ll poke at it with Docker Compose, inspect what’s really running, and play with some examples.
